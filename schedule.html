    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>The impact of online political trolling on democratic societies has attracted much scholarly attention. Most of the scholarly attention to the phenomenon concentrated on Western countries, while trolling in Africa has been understudied. Nigeria is the largest country on the continent, yet trolling of Nigerian politicians has been largely ignored. To address this gap, we examine the prevalence of online political trolling in the ‘Giant of Africa’ during the 2019 and 2023 presidential election cycles. Through content analysis of 2,400 Facebook comments, we found significant variations in trolling toward politicians based on their party affiliation, and variation between the two election cycles. Specifically, we identified a decrease in the prevalence of trolling toward politicians in Nigeria from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, trolling toward politicians from the two leading parties—the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)—was higher than that toward politicians from smaller parties. Trolling style also varied between politicians affiliated with the two leading parties. PDP politicians were the target of more trolling comments than APC politicians, and they were targeted more often by humorous trolling than serious trolling. In contrast, APC politicians were targeted more often by serious trolling comments.</p>

    <h3 id="gracey">Gracey Nana Amoakoa-Amoako</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Gracey is a second-year PhD student in the Information Science program, with a minor in Global Studies. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Sociology from the University of Ghana and a master’s in social work from Zhejiang Normal University.

Drawing on her interdisciplinary background, Gracey explores the sociotechnical dynamics of digital participation, information inequality, and the evolving role of technology in shaping public discourse.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>As digital platforms are shaping how political opinions are disseminated and formed, research on political trolling increasingly attracted scholarly attention; much of it focus on asynchronous settings. However, the increase in live-streaming on social media platforms, along with new forms of online political communication give rise to new forms of synchronous trolling. This exploratory study examines the prevailing trolling techniques in TikTok LIVE debate rooms, in the months leading to the 2024 US presidential election. While we found some overlap in trolling tactics, we identified also distinct tactics, including synchronous dialogue, breaking echo chamber, vocal, synchronous in-group and out-group, vocal and live viewers reactions; all of which foster TikTok LIVE trolling styles as narcissists, rhetorical, outburst and policing trolls.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>To raise awareness of the impacts of social media use in promoting social well-being for the greater good, this longitudinal research investigates how Facebook was used by protesters in the July 2024 Gen Z revolution in Bangladesh. Specifically, we examined the content, prevalence, and nature of user behaviors during six stages of the event by collecting Facebook posts (n= 2,095) and comments (n= 420,412) with the relevant hashtags (n= 42). Through a thematic content analysis of 5,174 comments, we found that the content shifted over time, from reforming quota, to reforming government, to reforming Bangladesh. Humorous trolling comments dominated posts targeting the government, while serious non-trolling comments supported the protesters. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of the changes over time in the content, the nature and the prevalence of political trolling, demonstrating the complex dynamics of technology, social media, and human interactions</p>

    <h3 id="amidu">Gordon Amidu</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Gordon Amidu is a doctoral student in Information Science at Indiana university Bloomington with a keen research interest in user engagement with social media and online trolling.

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Online discourse about contentious and ideological issues triggers trolling behaviors. This study aims to unveil the variations in the prevalence and nature of trolling comments on posts about undocumented immigrants by the public, politicians, and immigrants on Facebook and X. We found that almost 85% of the comments involved trolling, given the controversial topic. We found significant variations between the platforms, with significantly more trolling comments on Facebook posts, and significantly less ideological language used in comments on each platform. Furthermore, we found that the prevalence and style of trolling comments varied significantly between posts by the public and those by either politicians or immigrants.</p>

His current research interests include misinformation on social media.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>X’s Community Notes is a crowdsourced fact-checking system that relies on volunteer contributors to identify and annotate potentially misleading posts. To better align contributor activity with public demand, X recently introduced the Request a Community Note feature, allowing users to solicit fact-checks on specific tweets. Using 6.3 million requests and 1.9 million notes, we study how these requests shape the supply and demand of community-based fact-checking. We find that tweets receiving requests are significantly more likely to attract notes and to be annotated more quickly than comparable tweets without requests, suggesting that requests facilitate the production of fact-checks. However, requests remain unevenly fulfilled—only a small fraction result in notes, and most responses come from a small group of top contributors. Finally, requests help these contributors engage with a broader range of topics, partially mitigating concentration in note creation. Our findings highlight both the potential and the limits of requests in balancing supply and demand in community fact-checking.</p>

    <h3 id="shohana">Shohana Akter</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Shohana Akter is a PhD student in Information Science. Her research explores social media, digital activism, online trolling behavior, and political communication in general.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>This study revisits and extends on Kling’s (1994) genre framework to analyze contemporary social discourse on emerging technologies, particularly on Generative AI (GenAI).  By examining online discourse on X (formerly Twitter) between November 2022 to June 2023, we explored how people online engage in and frame the technological innovations using Kling’s genres on analyzing discourses about computerization. Our findings identified a newly identified genre which we named ‘Enhanced technological realism’ that consists of assessments and prospects of emerging technologies. Our content analysis showed that the discourse about GenAI is highly complex and requires multiple genres to capture the way people perceive the new technology. This study extends the theoretical framework to analyze the discourse about cauterization on social media. The study offers insights into how experts on X discuss GenAI and contribute to the field of social informatics.  </p>

    <h3 id="nosakhare">Nosakhare Okuonghae</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>I am a law librarian and a first-year Ph.D. student in Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington. My research intersects law, library practice, and artificial intelligence.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>AI is currently revolutionizing the landscape of information retrieval; however, certain concerns limit its full use for information retrieval. This study therefore examined AI algorithm bias awareness and ethical concerns as predictors of use of AI for information retrieval among LIS students in Nigeria. It adopted the descriptive type of the correlational research design in examining a group of Undergraduate Library and Information Science Students (LIS) in Nigeria. A total of 213 respondents were selected for the study using the accidental sampling technique of the non-probability type. Data collected were subjected to analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics with the aid of the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. The findings from the study revealed a significant relationship among AI algorithm bias awareness, ethical concerns and use of AI for information retrieval among LIS students in Nigeria. The study also showed a high level of LIS students` awareness of the potential bias in AI algorithm in information retrieval. In spite of this, the study recorded that the level of LIS students’ use of AI for information retrieval is high. The study concluded that the structure and content of LIS curriculum in Nigeria exposes the students to the rudiments of ICT application to librarianship, putting them at a position of knowledge-advantage. As a result, the students are able to discern the ethical concerns or issues involve in the use of AI for information retrieval.</p>

    <h3 id="jieli">Jieli Liu</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Jieli Liu is a Ph.D. student in Information Science in the Department of Information and Library Science in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington. She holds a Master of Library and Information Science from Peking University and a Bachelor of Library and Information Science from Sun Yat-sen University. Her research interests include generative AI and library science.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>This review synthesizes the rapidly expanding literature on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into library refence services. Framed by four research questions, it maps theoretical foundations, methodological trends, key findings, and future directions for AI‐enabled reference. A structured search was conducted across core LIS databases (ERIC, LISA, LISTA, Library Science Database, Library Literature & Information Science), supplemented by grey literature (e.g., Google Scholar) and citation chaining. The corpus reveals three dominant theoretical lenses—Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI)—and four prevalent methodological approaches: systematic reviews/bibliometrics, surveys, qualitative content analyses of AI responses, and case studies/pilots, with a smaller set of mixed-methods designs. Empirical findings converge on benefits (24/7 availability, scalability, and personalization) alongside persistent challenges (accuracy and credibility, privacy/security, algorithmic bias, and threats to intellectual freedom). Perceptions among librarians range from augmentation optimism to job-displacement anxiety, underscoring the need for change management and upskilling. The review contributes an integrated map of the field and a research agenda that prioritizes rigorous human-vs-AI comparative studies, equity and bias audits, and user-centered evaluation of multimodal LLMs. Overall, the evidence supports transparently governed AI to enhance—rather than replace—reference services.</p>

    <h3 id="zhuang">Zhibo Zhuang</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Zhibo Zhuang is a second-year PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington. She holds a master’s degree in Information Management from Sichuan University and dual bachelor’s degrees in English Literature and Business Administration from Shanghai International Studies University. Her research focuses on Digital Humanities, with particular interest in the intersection of archives, artificial intelligence, and memory studies. At the 2025 ASIS&amp;T Annual Meeting, she will present a poster exploring how large-language-model multi-agent simulations can transform oral history interviews from China’s Cultural Revolution into dynamic dialogues among artificial agents to enhance public engagement with histories.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence offer unprecedented opportunities to reimagine archival sources and deepen public engagement with contested histories. This study investigates how large-language-model (LLM) multi-agent simulations can transform oral-history interviews from China’s Cultural Revolution in Memories: The CR/10 Project into dynamic dialogues among artificial agents. Using the open-source tool TinyTroupe, we construct personas grounded in authentic testimony and embed them in themed conversation spaces focused on memory, reconciliation, intergenerational understanding, and historical responsibility. The resulting simulations enable audiences to observe how divergent personal narratives collide, converge, and evolve across generations, providing a richer appreciation of this complex past. Preliminary findings indicate that LLM-driven agents can convey multifaceted historical experience in a more immersive and interactive form than traditional interfaces.</p>

    <h3 id="kang">Gyuri Kang</h3>
    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>Gyuri Kang is a third-year PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington. She holds two master’s degrees in English and Information Science from the University at Albany, and a bachelor’s in English Language and Culture from Hanyang University in Korea. Her research lies in the digital environmental humanities, where she works at the intersection of humanistic inquiry into environmental issues and digital computing. She uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to answer humanistic questions about environmental problems of our age, specifically focusing on social and cultural relationships with the natural world mediated by texts, media, and history.</p>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>The nonhuman, any entity that is not human, has been widely studied in the humanities and social sciences. In ecologically oriented fiction, also known as ecofiction, environmental themes are frequently represented by nonhuman living entities, such as plants and nonhuman animals. These nonhuman living entities in literature exhibit agency to some extent, functioning as living organisms rather than passive background elements. Many literary studies have observed nonhuman agency in environmental fiction through qualitative methods. On the other hand, there is a lack of quantitative analysis of nonhuman agency in fictional settings. Through quantitative methods, this study examines the actions of nonhuman living entities in various works of ecofiction, categorizing them as either agentic (e.g., deciding, planning) or experiencer (e.g., feeling, sensing). In 75 ecofiction books, I identify 1,230 biological taxa of nonhuman living entities associated with 84 agentic verbs and 39 experiencer verbs using the existing dictionaries of agentic and experiencer verbs and word embeddings. I compare the number of human characters and that of biological taxa of nonhuman living entities, as well as their actions, to visualize how biodiversity and our creative descriptions of nonhuman actions have been changing in literary scope. I also find several similarities and differences between the literary representations of human and nonhuman actions in ecofiction. By applying natural language processing (NLP) tools in studying nonhuman actions in ecofiction, this study will contribute to both digital and environmental humanities scholarship.</p>
