<h2>Bios and abstracts</h2>
<h3 id="akwa">Glory Akwa</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Glory Akwa is a Ph.D. student in Information Science with research interests in **Social Informatics**. She graduated with **First-Class Honours** in Library and Information Science from the University of Uyo, Nigeria, where she received a three-year fully funded Nigerian Federal Government Scholarship. She completed her internship with TotalEnergies and was honored as the Best Graduating Student, receiving the Chief Ernest Etim Prize for academic excellence from Uniuyo.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The impact of online political trolling on democratic societies has attracted much scholarly attention. Most of the scholarly attention to the phenomenon concentrated on Western countries, while trolling in Africa has been **understudied**. To address this gap, we examine the prevalence of online political trolling in the ‘Giant of Africa’ during the **2019 and 2023 presidential election cycles**. Through content analysis of 2,400 Facebook comments, we found significant variations in trolling toward politicians based on their party affiliation, and variation between the two election cycles. Specifically, we identified a **decrease in the prevalence of trolling** toward politicians in Nigeria from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, trolling toward politicians from the two leading parties—the All Progressives Congress (**APC**) and the Peoples Democratic Party (**PDP**)—was higher than that toward politicians from smaller parties. Trolling style also varied between politicians affiliated with the two leading parties. PDP politicians were the target of more trolling comments than APC politicians, and they were targeted more often by **humorous trolling** than serious trolling. In contrast, APC politicians were targeted more often by **serious trolling** comments.</p>
<h3 id="amoakoa-amoako">Gracey Nana Amoakoa-Amoako</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Gracey is a second-year PhD student in the Information Science program, with a minor in **Global Studies**. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Sociology from the University of Ghana and a master’s in social work from Zhejiang Normal University. Her research centers on **online communities**, with a particular interest in how engagement and interaction are organized across digital platforms. Drawing on her interdisciplinary background, Gracey explores the sociotechnical dynamics of digital participation, information inequality, and the evolving role of technology in shaping public discourse.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>As digital platforms are shaping how political opinions are disseminated and formed, research on political trolling increasingly attracted scholarly attention; much of it focus on asynchronous settings. However, the increase in live-streaming on social media platforms, along with new forms of online political communication give rise to new forms of **synchronous trolling**. This exploratory study examines the prevailing trolling techniques in **TikTok LIVE debate rooms**, in the months leading to the 2024 US presidential election. While we found some overlap in trolling tactics, we identified also distinct tactics, including synchronous dialogue, breaking echo chamber, vocal, synchronous in-group and out-group, vocal and live viewers reactions; all of which foster TikTok LIVE trolling styles as **narcissists, rhetorical, outburst and policing trolls**.</p>
<h3 id="subat">Athkia Subat</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Athkia is currently pursuing a PhD with a major in **Information Science** and a minor in **Information Systems**. Her recent doctoral research explores digital media communication and social protests, focusing on how social media enabled trolling influence organizational behavior and public discourse. She has recently presented her work at international conferences, including the Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS 2025) and the Political Networks and Computational Social Science Conference (PolNet PaCSS 2025). She is currently contributing to discussions on AI manipulation and user attitudes. Alongside her research, she supports teaching and collaborative projects in data-driven communication and information analysis, reflecting her commitment to understanding the social implications of emerging technologies</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>To raise awareness of the impacts of social media use in promoting social well-being for the greater good, this longitudinal research investigates how **Facebook** was used by protesters in the **July 2024 Gen Z revolution in Bangladesh**. Specifically, we examined the content, prevalence, and nature of user behaviors during six stages of the event by collecting Facebook posts (n= 2,095) and comments (n= 420,412) with the relevant hashtags (n= 42). Through a thematic content analysis of 5,174 comments, we found that the content shifted over time, from reforming quota, to reforming government, to reforming Bangladesh. **Humorous trolling comments** dominated posts targeting the government, while **serious non-trolling comments** supported the protesters. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of the changes over time in the content, the nature and the prevalence of political trolling, demonstrating the complex dynamics of technology, social media, and human interactions</p>
<h3 id="amidu">Gordon Amidu</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Gordon Amidu is a doctoral student in Information Science at Indiana university Bloomington with a keen research interest in user engagement with social media and **online trolling**. He holds a bachelor’s degree in information studies with a minor in the study of religions from the University of Ghana and a master’s in library and information science from Andhra University in India.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Online discourse about contentious and ideological issues triggers trolling behaviors. This study aims to unveil the variations in the prevalence and nature of trolling comments on posts about **undocumented immigrants** by the public, politicians, and immigrants on **Facebook and X**. We found that almost **85% of the comments involved trolling**, given the controversial topic. We found significant variations between the platforms, with significantly more trolling comments on Facebook posts, and significantly less ideological language used in comments on each platform. Furthermore, we found that the prevalence and style of trolling comments varied significantly between posts by the **public** and those by either **politicians or immigrants**.</p>
<h3 id="gong">Yilin Gong</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Yilin Gong is a PhD student in **Information Science** at Indiana University Bloomington. He completed his undergraduate degree in Information Science at CU Boulder and earned a master's in Data Science from the University of Chicago. His current research interests include **misinformation on social media**.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>**X’s Community Notes** is a crowdsourced fact-checking system that relies on volunteer contributors to identify and annotate potentially misleading posts. To better align contributor activity with public demand, X recently introduced the **Request a Community Note feature**, allowing users to solicit fact-checks on specific tweets. Using 6.3 million requests and 1.9 million notes, we study how these requests shape the supply and demand of community-based fact-checking. We find that tweets receiving requests are significantly more likely to attract notes and to be annotated more quickly than comparable tweets without requests, suggesting that requests **facilitate the production of fact-checks**. However, requests remain unevenly fulfilled—only a small fraction result in notes, and most responses come from a small group of top contributors. Finally, requests help these contributors engage with a broader range of topics, partially mitigating concentration in note creation. Our findings highlight both the potential and the limits of requests in balancing supply and demand in community fact-checking.</p>
<h3 id="akter">Shohana Akter</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Shohana Akter is a PhD student in **Information Science**. Her research explores social media, digital activism, online trolling behavior, and political communication in general.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This study revisits and extends on **Kling’s (1994) genre framework** to analyze contemporary social discourse on emerging technologies, particularly on **Generative AI (GenAI)**. By examining online discourse on X (formerly Twitter) between November 2022 to June 2023, we explored how people online engage in and frame the technological innovations using Kling’s genres on analyzing discourses about computerization. Our findings identified a newly identified genre which we named **‘Enhanced technological realism’** that consists of assessments and prospects of emerging technologies. Our content analysis showed that the discourse about GenAI is highly complex and requires multiple genres to capture the way people perceive the new technology. This study extends the theoretical framework to analyze the discourse about cauterization on social media. The study offers insights into how experts on X discuss GenAI and contribute to the field of **social informatics**.</p>
