 <h3 id="wingate">Alex Wingate</h3>
 <h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Alex Wingate is a PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington. She holds a Masters of Library Science from Indiana University and an MA in the History of the Book from the University of London. Her research focuses on booksellers in early modern Navarre, Spain and the intersection between book history and information science. She is also the Bibliography Editor for both the Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project and SHARP News.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>Descriptions of books in the 16th and 17th centuries are often encountered as part of inventories of goods. The different books are enumerated and described in a list somewhat like a written or printed library catalog. Unlike library catalogs which follow metadata standards for consistent cataloging within a single library or between libraries, inventories did not necessarily adhere to a standard—even within the same inventory. However, court testimony from the 17th century suggests a customary book description standard existed between booksellers in Navarre, Spain. To see whether such a standard was used by book professionals and non-professionals, this study analyzes TEI-encoded inventories of the books of 16 priests and 3 booksellers from the 16th and 17th centuries. Preliminary analysis suggests that a rough standard existed among booksellers for what pieces of metadata should be used to describe a book (structure) and how to refer to certain works and authors (controlled vocabulary). Non-professionals did not utilize the structure standard but did use the informal controlled vocabulary. This investigation helps us to better understand how these important book historical sources were made and shed light on historical metadata creation practices.</P>
 <h3 id="pope">Andy Pope</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>I am a 4th year PhD student in the Information Science program. My research interests include the material culture of the ancient world, public interaction with historical information and artifacts, and educational programming in public libraries. I previously earned an MA in Ancient History and Languages as well as a Master of Library Science. Upon earning my degrees, I became a youth services librarian and later a library department manager. I returned work on my PhD full time in 2023. Although I miss story times, collection development, and having my own office, I am excited about my work now and feel genuine passion for my research.    </p>
 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>Virtual reality (VR) and generative AI (GenAI) have begun to disrupt the delivery of historical education to the global public. History professionals, archaeologists, schoolteachers and others must quickly come to understand how these technologies modify the learning process. Traditionally, the study of history strengthened individual and collective identity, provided contextual knowledge about world affairs, and helped students develop critical thinking skills.  While VR and GenAI have the potential to greatly enhance such learning outcomes and increase public awareness of history and access to historical sites, there is also the potential for failure, epistemic injustice, and abuses that affect both students and society at large. In this presentation, I will discuss my current research into the views of academic historians toward generative AI, new research into the effect of VR in archaeology and education, and legal research into the rights of individuals in virtual learning environments. This work answers an urgent research gap as these technologies are already having an impact on historical education and their consequences are poorly understood.</p>
 <h3 id="kang">Gyuri Kang</h3>
 <h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Gyuri Kang is a second-year PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University. She holds two master’s in English and Information Science from University at Albany, and a bachelor’s in English Language and Culture from Hanyang University in Korea. Her research lies in the digital environmental humanities, where she works at the intersection of humanistic inquiry into environmental issues and digital computing.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>This paper will investigate potential relationships between two English poets, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Algernon Charles Swinburne, by applying computational methods to investigate discourses related to nature and the environment in their poetry. Like the work of many other Romantic and Victorian poets, the works of Shelley and Swinburne are rich with representations of the natural world and reflections on poetry’s relationship to that world. Swinburne, an acknowledged disciple of Shelley, has himself commented on Shelley’s appropriations of the natural world. Swinburne describes an encounter with nature that is intense, profound, and significant but also less descriptive and less concerned with material particulars. Our study seeks to unpack further Shelley’s and Swinburne’s poetic interactions with the natural world. For our study, we have compiled plain text versions of 313 poems by Shelley and 435 poems by Swinburne. Using a suite of text analysis and visualization tools, we will conduct word-frequency analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis on the text corpora. First, we will build word-frequency lists and topic models to examine nature-related keywords and topics. Next, we will conduct sentiment analysis to evaluate the sentiments and emotions present in each poet’s nature-related discourse. Finally, we will perform network analysis to explore connections between individual poems and nature-related keywords. In addition to distant reading, we will amplify the preliminary qualitative analysis results through targeted close reading. Having applied this mixed-methods approach, we will report our findings on the similarities and differences in each poet’s discourse on the natural world.</P>
<h3 id="wang">Haining Wang</h3>
  <h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Haining Wang is a doctoral candidate at ILS, working on language modeling and processing.</p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>A vast amount of scholarly work is published daily, yet much of it remains inaccessible to the general public due to dense jargon and complex language. To address this challenge in science communication, we introduced a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions. Trained using reinforcement learning guided by a carefully balanced combination of word-level and sentence-level accessibility rewards, our language model effectively substitutes technical terms with more accessible alternatives, a task where models fine-tuned or guided by conventional readability measures fall short. The rewritten abstracts generated by our model can be comprehended by middle school students, showing a three-grade-level improvement in readability, or roughly a 90% relative enhancement, compared to a supervised fine-tuning baseline, all while maintaining factual integrity and high-quality language. An in-depth analysis of the impact of our approach demonstrated that carefully balanced rewards lead to systematic modifications to the base model and are likely responsible for smoother optimization and superior performance. We envision this work as a step toward bridging the gap between scholarly research and the general public, particularly younger readers and those without a college degree.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>My talk will discuss a project that I worked on which I will be co-presenting about at ASIS&T. The project centers on utilizing content analysis of Tweets related to the January 6th, 2021, insurrection. After creating our dataset of tweets and gathering literature on the topic, we developed a codebook and manually coded a sample of the tweets. The next phase will include training an algorithmic model to computationally code the rest of the dataset. There has been much published about the insurrection, such as about how the events were portrayed in the media and analyses of the causes of the insurrection. However, very little has been researched on tweets related to the insurrection. Our project examines the different frames that have been used in tweets to describe January 6th. The importance of this work is that it has implications for how the day will be remembered in the future.  </p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>While the integration of Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into daily interactions is growing, the associated user privacy concerns have not been comprehensively studied. In this paper, we conducted a qualitative analysis of a sample of 305 posts (6182 comments and 193 images) demonstrating privacy concerns about conversational persona chatbots from the /r/CharacterAI forum on Reddit. The analysis involved a detailed examination of themes and patterns in user-generated content to uncover nuanced perspectives on privacy issues within the context of AI-driven persona-based chatbot interactions. Our results show that users were mostly concerned with data security, consent, and transparency issues in these chatbot platforms. However, community discussions frequently centered on data ownership, copyright, and privacy enhancement strategies, indicating a heightened user awareness of privacy rights. This paper concludes with a set of recommendations, including that AI developers and platform providers should implement clear privacy policies and adopt data minimization strategies, educators and technology advocates should promote AI literacy, and policymakers should establish regulatory frameworks. Addressing these concerns is crucial for creating a secure and trustworthy environment for conversational AI users.</p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4>
  <p>As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly prevalent in the workplace, organizations are focused on how this technology can enhance productivity. Existing research highlights that GenAI has the potential to either augment human workers, thereby boosting their productivity, or replace them by automating certain tasks. However, the broader impact of GenAI integration on productivity at the organizational level remains under-explored. This study seeks to address this gap by interviewing 20 employees from technology companies in China and the United States (10 from each country) to investigate how organizational roles, cultures, and responsibilities affect the implementation of GenAI for productivity enhancement and innovation. Preliminary findings suggest that organizations play a critical role in accelerating the adoption of GenAI. Additionally, GenAI applications have been integrated into product designs for internal management and innovation at the organizational level. Furthermore, organizations assume certain responsibilities when employees encounter challenges or risks related to GenAI usage. This study provides a preliminary overview of how organizations are navigating technological change through the integration of GenAI, laying the groundwork for further empirical research on its impact on the workforce, job design, and organizational innovation.</p>

 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>While scholarly research on deepfakes is extensive, there is a notable gap in the literature on the public perception of the financial threats that AI-generated deepfakes pose. This paper makes two contributions to existing literature. It first highlights the emergence of financial threats as a by-product of AI-generated deepfakes technology and the importance of understanding users’ values, reasons, attitudes, and behaviors while delving into deepfake cases. Then, it proposes a research agenda based on Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), to guide future investigations of deepfakes in scam scholarship.</p>
  <h3 id="amidu">Gordon Amidu</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Gordon Amidu is a doctoral student in Information Science, whose research focuses on user engagement with social media and online trolling. In addition to pursuing his PhD, he is also working towards a Master’s in Information Science (MIS). He holds a Bachelor's degree from the University of Ghana and a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science from Andhra University in India.</p>
 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>This study addresses a significant gap in the literature on political trolling in Ghana's social media landscape. While limited research has explored online political discourse in Ghana, focusing on insults directed at political leaders (Thompson, 2021), the use of memes to criticize corruption (Ofori et al., 2023), and the prevalence of hate speech and fake news (John et al., 2021; Elena et al., 2019), a comprehensive examination of how politics and religion contribute to trolling behaviors is lacking. Previous studies have highlighted the role of anonymity in facilitating insulting behavior online and the use of abusive language in Ghanaian politics (Shadrack, 2017; Kwame et al., 2013). However, the extent and styles of political trolling within Ghanaian social media discourse remain underexplored. This research aims to fill this gap by investigating the intersection of religion, political discourse, and trolling behaviors in Ghana's digital political landscape. By examining these factors in the context of technological advancements and the rise of social media, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of online political communication in Ghana and its implications for democratic discourse.</p>
<h3 id="yan">Yueru Yan</h3>

 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>With the increase in social live streaming services (SLSSs), different streamers create and share content to engage with their audiences in real time. The combination of SLSSs and E-commerce also offers opportunities for people whose family members are severely ill, disabled, or old and facilitates their ability to raise funds by selling commodities and receiving virtual gifts. Because it is possible that these hardship live streamers may effectively use different self-presentation techniques than other streamers, and that their self-presentation may vary by gender, we analyzed TikTok video clips and sales data of 14 male and female hardship streamers. We found that the hardship streamers used multi-modal cues to facilitate interactivity and authenticity, as they emphasized their hardship and promoted the product. We also found that higher literacy level of the streamers and the use of a positive tone positively correlated with sales performance, and that hardship storytelling positively correlated with the time the audience stayed in their live streaming sessions. Compared with males, females focused more on their hardships, used a more negative tone, and talked faster. We provide a unique understanding of the effectiveness of self-presentation strategies used by marginalized live streamers in raising funds on TikTok.</p>
